# MongoDB $in Operator with Null Values

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with null values.  The incorrect usage leads to unexpected behavior. The solution shows the correct approach to handle null values within `$in` queries.

## Problem
Incorrectly using the `$in` operator with an array containing `null` values can lead to unexpected results.  MongoDB's behavior with `null` in this context might not always be intuitive.

## Solution
The solution involves checking for `null` values explicitly or using alternative query operators to achieve the desired filtering result.  This ensures that queries are reliable and behave as expected.  See `bugSolution.js` for the corrected code.
